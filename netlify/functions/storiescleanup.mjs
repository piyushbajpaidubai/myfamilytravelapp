/* Trip Stories — sweep out what has expired. Runs every 15 minutes.

   Expiry is already enforced where it matters: the read policy on trip_stories
   requires expires_at > now(), so the moment a story is past its hour it is
   invisible to everybody, including someone calling the REST API directly with a
   good token. This job is not what makes stories disappear. It is what stops the
   remains piling up — the file in the bucket, which costs storage, and the row,
   which costs an index.

   That distinction matters if this function ever breaks: nothing becomes visible
   that should not be. The failure mode is a bill, not a leak.

   Required Netlify env vars:
     SUPABASE_URL           e.g. https://lafpiwlpjvongtdtzuam.supabase.co
     SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY   service role key — deletes past RLS; NEVER shipped to the client

   Known gap, deliberately not chased: a photo whose upload succeeded but whose row
   insert failed AND whose compensating delete also failed has no row, so nothing
   here can find it. Both halves have to fail for that, and finding such files means
   walking every prefix in the bucket on every run. If storage grows without stories
   to explain it, that walk is the thing to write.
