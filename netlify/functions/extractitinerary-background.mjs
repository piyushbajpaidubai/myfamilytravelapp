// This is a *background* function (the -background suffix is what makes it one). That is
// not a preference: a synchronous Netlify function is capped at ten seconds, and the cap
// applies to streamed responses too — streaming keeps a connection from going idle but
// buys no extra runtime. An extraction on a multi-page PDF comfortably outlasts ten
// seconds, so the first version of this was killed mid-read every time. Background
// functions get fifteen minutes.
//
// The trade is that a background function answers 202 immediately and can never return a
// result to its caller. So the caller invents a job id, posts it here, and then polls
// extractitinerary.mjs, which reads whatever this wrote to the blob store under that id.

Rules that matter more than completeness:
- Never invent a date, a time, or a flight number. If the document does not state it, return "".
- Do not convert timezones or adjust times. Copy the local time exactly as printed.
- A date with no year: infer the year from the trip dates you are given, and only from those.
- Split a multi-leg journey into one travel item per leg, each with its own flight number.
- A hotel is one stay item spanning check-in to check-out, not one per night.
- Only tag people the document names. Never distribute an unattributed item across everyone.
- Include items whose dates fall outside the trip — they are flagged for the traveller, not dropped by you.`;
