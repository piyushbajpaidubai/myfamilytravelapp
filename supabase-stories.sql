-- =====================================================================
--  My Travel Hub — Trip Stories (step 1 of 5: the backend)
--  Run ONCE in Supabase → SQL Editor. Safe to re-run.
--
--  A traveller's first item starts a one-hour session. Up to three items
--  go in it; later ones do not extend the hour. At one hour the whole
--  session disappears. A further upload starts a fresh hour.
--
--  Who sees what:
--    owner / member / invited viewer  → can watch, while it is live
--    owner / member                   → can post
--    author, or a trip captain        → can delete
--    a ?view= share link              → nothing at all, deliberately
--
--  Two things are enforced here rather than in the app:
--    1. Expiry. The read policy itself requires expires_at > now(), so an
--       expired story is unreadable even to someone calling the REST API
--       directly with a good token. "Disappears immediately" is true
--       rather than a matter of the app remembering to filter.
--    2. The three-item cap, as a column constraint, so it holds even if
--       the app has a bug.
-- =====================================================================

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 1. Is this person a captain of this trip?
--    The creator always is. Others are captains if the trip's own roster
--    says so — which is keyed by the app's user id, not the auth uid, so
--    it has to go through profiles. security definer because the policies
--    that call it must see rows the caller cannot.

-- 2. The stories themselves.
--    One row per item. The session is carried on the row rather than in a
--    table of its own: with a three-item cap a join earns nothing, and it
--    makes expiry a single column, which is what the policy keys on.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 3. Is the story at this path still live?
--    Used by the storage policy below. security definer so it can see the
--    row regardless of who is asking — the caller's own access is decided
--    separately, by trip membership.
